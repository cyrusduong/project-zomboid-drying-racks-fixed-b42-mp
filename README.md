# Context Menu Craft Leather Fix - Build 42 MP

A Project Zomboid mod that fixes broken leather crafting mechanics by adding context menu options to drying racks for instant processing of wet furred leather into dried leather.

> **Note**: This is a temporary fix mod intended to restore leather crafting functionality until the official crafting system is fully implemented in the base game.

## Description

This mod addresses the leather crafting issues introduced in Project Zomboid Build 42 where the vanilla drying rack system became partially broken. Instead of relying on the traditional time-based drying mechanics, this mod provides instant leather processing through intuitive context menu interactions.

### Key Features

- **Instant Leather Processing**: Right-click any drying rack to instantly dry wet furred leather
- **Comprehensive Leather Support**: Works with all 18 wet furred leather types from vanilla
- **Smart Rack Validation**: Proper size compatibility checking (small, medium, large racks)
- **Multiplayer Compatible**: Full B42 multiplayer support with proper inventory synchronization
- **Type-Safe Implementation**: Built with EmmyLua type checking for reliability

## Supported Leather Types

### Small Leather (11 types)
- Rabbit, Rabbit Grey, Raccoon Grey
- Piglet Landrace, Piglet Black, Fawn, Lamb  
- Calf Angus, Calf Holstein, Calf Simmental
- Crude Small

### Medium Leather (4 types)
- Pig Landrace, Pig Black, Sheep

## Development

This mod was developed using the PZ-Umbrella framework for enhanced type safety and development experience. The umbrella types provide comprehensive API documentation and type checking for Project Zomboid Lua development.

### Build Requirements
- Project Zomboid Build 42
- EmmyLua IDE plugin (recommended)
- PZ-Umbrella types (included as submodule)

### Local Testing Setup
To test the mod locally without using Steam Workshop:

1. **Install to Workshop Directory**:
   ```bash
   # Remove any existing installation
   rm -rf ~/Zomboid/Workshop/LeatherDryingRack
   
   # Copy the Contents folder (required by workshop uploader)
   cp -r /path/to/project/Contents ~/Zomboid/Workshop/LeatherDryingRack
   
   # Copy mod.info and preview.png to root (required for workshop compatibility)
   cp /path/to/project/mod.info ~/Zomboid/Workshop/LeatherDryingRack/
   cp /path/to/project/preview.png ~/Zomboid/Workshop/LeatherDryingRack/
   ```

2. **Directory Structure**:
   ```
   ~/Zomboid/Workshop/LeatherDryingRack/
   ├── mod.info                    # Workshop requires this at root
   ├── preview.png                 # Workshop requires this at root
   └── Contents/                   # All mod files must be inside this
       └── mods/
           └── LeatherDryingRack/
               ├── mod.info         # Nested copy for compatibility
               ├── preview.png      # Nested copy for compatibility
               └── 42/
                   └── media/
                       └── lua/
   ```

3. **Important Notes**:
   - **No symlinks**: Workshop uploader and game engine don't support symlinks
   - **Both locations**: `mod.info` and `preview.png` must exist in root and nested locations
   - **Contents folder**: Workshop uploader requires all files inside `Contents/` folder
   - **Real-time testing**: Launch PZ after copying files to test immediately

4. **Development Workflow**:
   - Edit files in project source
   - Run the copy commands above to update workshop installation
   - Launch Project Zomboid to test changes
   - Enable mod in PZ mods menu

This structure ensures compatibility with both manual installation and Steam Workshop requirements.
